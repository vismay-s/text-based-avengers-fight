# text-based-avengers-fight
One of my first experiences with tkinter library. I have made a text based game with Avenger's characters.

Tkinter is for providing python GUI.
I tried to integrate it with some basic python coding to get a fun application by using some Pokemon features from the old games.

You can further improve the game experience as desired by deducting damage for repeated same moves or increasing miss chances.

Experiment, Code and Enjoy.
